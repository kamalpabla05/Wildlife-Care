        <h1>1. Sumatran Tiger</h1>
        <p><b>Status: Critically Endangered<br>Estimated Population: 328 – 908</b><br>Recent surveys about Sumatran Tiger have demonstrated a population decline of 16.6% between 2000 and 2012. There are only two viable populations left, defined by the presence of 30 or more females of breeding age. They have traditionally inhabited forested areas in both the lowlands and mountains on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. The majority of the remaining Sumatran Tigers live in a series of dispersed but fragmented national parks, although about 100 remain in unprotected forest that is rapidly being eroded.</p>

        <h1>2. Sumatran Elephant</h1>
        <p><b>Status: Critically Endangered<br>Estimated Population: Less than 2800</b><br>The most up-to-date survey of Sumatran Elephant populations was in 2008 when it was estimated that there were between 2,400 and 2,800 left in the wild. However the population has been only declining over the years. Dozens of herds have died out in the past 40 years and they became locally extinct in 23 of their 43 known ranges. There was 50% population loss between 1985 and 2007. The Sumatran Elephant is critically endangered species due to Sumatra’s long-running deforestation practices.</p>

        <p><b>Status: Critically Endangered<br>Estimated Population: 1,20,000</b><br>There are three species of Orangutan – the Sumerian, Bornean, and Tapanuli Orangutans. All three are considered to be critically endangered. Across all three species, there are estimated to be less than 120,000 Orangutans left in the world. Tapanuli Orangutan – Fewer than 800; Sumatran Orangutan – About 13,500; Bornean Orangutan – Between 55,000 and 105,000, considering that in 1976, there were over 280,000 Bornean Orangutans alone.</p>

        <h1>4. Gorilla</h1>
        <p><b>Status: Critically Endangered<br>Estimated Population: Less than 3,20,000</b><br>There are two species of Gorilla, the Eastern Gorilla and the Western Gorilla, and they both have two subspecies. The Eastern Lowlands, Western Lowlands, and Cross River Gorillas are all critically endangered with extremely low and declining wild populations. There are estimated to be 2,600 Eastern Lowlands Gorillas and 316,000 Western Lowlands Gorillas. The Cross River Gorilla is a sub-species of the Western Lowlands Gorilla with a population estimated at 250-300. All Gorillas are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in nations such as Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

        <p><b>Status: Critically Endangered<br>Estimated Population: Less than 30,000</b><br>There are three of five species of Rhinoceros who are critically endangered. These are the Black Rhino, Javan Rhinoceros, and Sumatran Rhinoceros. The White Rhino is ‘near threatened’ and the Greater One-Horned Rhino is ‘vulnerable’. There are less than 80 Sumatran Rhinos left in the world. The estimated species populations in 2022 are as follows:<br>Black Rhino: 5,366 – 5,627; Javan Rhino: 74; Sumatran Rhino: Less than 80; Greater One-Horned Rhino: 3,588; White Rhino: 17,212 – 18,915</p>

        <h1>6. Giant Panda</h1>
        <p><b>Status: Vulnerable<br>Estimated Population: 1800</b><br>The Giant Panda’s status was lowered to ‘vulnerable’ on the IUCN red list in 2016. The Giant Panda was on the brink of extinction for much of the 20th Century. The population dropped to a low of 1,216 in 1988. The population has recently risen to about 1,800 and the Chinese government also downgraded its status from Endangered to Vulnerable in July 2021. The Giant Panda is found in the hills of the Qinling mountains in Sichuan province in China. Its habitat is bamboo forests which were rapidly deforested throughout the 20th Century.</p>
